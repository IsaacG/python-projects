# I want an RSS client
# It should read URLs from a file
# It should cache what it already fetched so it knows what is new
# Should it poll?
# I am using this to fetch graphical RSS items so it needs to embed the content in an HTML file
# Maybe have it spit out one HTML file per fetch? Then I can loop through HTML files, open and delete
